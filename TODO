Priorities:
- Add simple MySQL based config interface (for client config in particular)
  * Keep a client list with last-seen timestamp and option to "clean it up"
  * Choose classes from the ones present in current import files, as a list with "select all" / "select none"
- Add support for IOF XML to read metadata about the event directly from the import file
- Add support for mobile devices (on-site result wifi) 
  * probably without auto-update for now
  * single column with scrolling
  * maybe select class from a dropdown list for easier navigation
- Add support for speaker intermediate results (by control)
  * display as extra columns like in OE?
  * display results at one particular control


Nice to have: Live update of the data being displayed (particularly for speaker results)

* Compare the entire CSV to the previous version and identify lines that are identical (except for rank)
* Mark new lines with colored background and maybe slide them in
* If lines have been removed, stuff gets complicated - probably it's easier to reset the file completely in this case?
* Ensure that the current page is displayed at least ~3 more secs if something has changed on it
* Anchor the pagination to the first (unchanged) line of the current page, go through until the end,
  then restart with new pagination
* Optionally, keep track of when each line of the CSV appeared and color runners that have newly arrived within X minutes
  even if they were already there when the page loaded.
